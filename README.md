**DESCRIPTION:**

For this project, I built a database using MongoDB that focuses on the NBA Summer League--specifically, the top 15 players from the 2021 NBA draft class.

It is intended for basketball enthusiasts and gamblers as a reference guide for advanced analytics relating to this specific set of players.

Nivo was used to construct the charts and graphs.
